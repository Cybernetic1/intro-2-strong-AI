\section{Natural language is not essential to AGI}

Our approach is to define a logic that can faithfully render arbitrary natural-language texts.  We call such a logical form Geniform.  The translation of NL to Geniform can itself be encoded as logical rules, thus the parsing of NL can be achieved via logical inference (as forward-chaining in a bottom-up manner).  And since logical inference is reversible, the generation of NL will also come as free.

All the irregularities of NL will be taken care of via machine learning.

\subsection{Background: unification-based grammars}

The family of unification-based grammars includes LFG (Lexical Functional Grammar), HPSG (Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar), and PATR grammar.  The unification algorithm used in unification-based grammar is the same as the unification algorithm used in logic.  This is further evidence that the brain employs abstract symbolic processing similar to formal logic.

\subsection{Background: cognitive linguistics}

Our approach is closer to ``formal semantics''.  Many authors, most famously Richard Montague, have argued that natural languages are formal languages.  Some have also advocated the use of natural language as knowledge representation in AI.  Thus the line between formal and natural languages is blurred.

\section{Abduction as interpretation}
\label{sec:abduction-as-interpretation}

\subsection{A detailed example}

The general sequence is:\\
\hspace*{1cm} tokenization $\rightarrow$ POS-tagging $\rightarrow$ syntax parsing $\rightarrow$ semantic parsing\\
which should be familiar to everyone with experience in NL processing.

Let's begin with:\\
\tab \english{John loves Mary}.

The grammar:\\
\tab Sentence ::= NP VP\\
\tab NP ::= Noun\\
\tab VP ::= Verb NP\\
\tab Verb ::= \english{loves} \\
\tab Noun ::= \english{John} $|$ \english{Mary}\\
Though it can only recognize 2 sentences, they are arguably the most important sentences in natural language.

The crucial thing is that we represent everything in a logic-based framework. First we represent the sentence as "raw data" (ignoring tenses to simplify matters):\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{sentence}(e_0)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-John}(e_1)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-love}(e_2)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-Mary}(e_3)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{begins-with}(e_0, e_1)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{follows}(e_2, e_1)$\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{follows}(e_3, e_2)$\\
where:\\
\hspace*{1cm} the $e_i$'s are \textbf{entities} (logical constants).\\
\hspace*{1cm} the entities $e_1$, $e_2$, and $e_3$ are words.\\
\hspace*{1cm} follows() means a word follows another word in a sentence.

Up to now, all we have is a sentence as raw text (without meanings).  The next step is to recognize parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc). We can use logical rules to do this.

An example logical rule is:\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-Mary}(X) \rightarrow \exists e \; \mbox{parse-as}(e, X) \wedge \mbox{noun}(e)$\\
which simply means that the word "Mary" is a noun. X is a variable (implicitly universally quantified). $e$ is a new entity, which instantiates to $e_4$ when the rule is applied.

We can also use logical rules to parse syntax. We can perform ``VP $\leftarrow verb + noun$'' with this rule\footnote{We need this special rule:\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{follows}(X_1, X_2) \wedge \mbox{parse-as}(X_1, X_3) \wedge \mbox{parse-as}(X_2, X_4) \rightarrow \mbox{follows2}(X_3, X_4)$ }:\\
\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{verb}(X_1) \wedge \mbox{noun}(X_2) \wedge \mbox{follows2}(X_2, X_1) \rightarrow \exists e \; \mbox{parse-as}(e, X_1, X_2) \wedge vp(e)$\\
which creates a new entity $e_5$ which is a VP.

Assume that eventually we have a parse of the sentence S, $e_6$. Notice that up to now, it is all syntactic parsing.

Next we perform semantic parsing.  The key is to generate partial meanings for phrases, such as the verb phrase ``loves Mary''.

\textbf{Lambda operator.}  In formal semantics, it is customary to use the $\lambda$ operator to represent the meaning of phrases.  The reason is that first-order logic do not have the expressive power to represent such phrases.  For example, the VP ``loves Mary'' denotes ``somebody's loving Mary'', which may be represented as $love(\_ \,,mary)$; but that is not a well-formed formula in FOL.  Instead we can represent it using the $\lambda$ expression $\lambda x \; love(x,mary)$.

\textbf{Composition of concepts.}  (For details see \S\ref{sec:composition})  Under this method, all phrases are represented by compositions.  For example, the VP ``loves Mary'' can be represented by $app(loves,mary)$, or in short form $mary \circ loves$.  This composite is a \textit{first-order object}, ie, a first-class citizen in the logic which can be further manipulated or modified, eg, when we compose it with $john$, we get $((mary \circ loves) \circ john)$ which is equivalent to the FOL statement $loves(john,mary)$.

I think this method is superior to $\lambda$ because the meanings of phrases can be represented by first-order objects.  It also makes semantic parsing very intuitive.

% \todo{Revise this example with the newly improved Geniform.}

\todo{Explain semantic parsing with examples.}

%A semantic rule is similar to a syntactic one:\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-love}(X) rightarrow \exists e \; \mbox{parse-as}(e, X) \wedge \mbox{verb}(e) \wedge \mbox{means}(e, \mbox{concept-love})$\\
%
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{verb}(X_1) \wedge \mbox{np}(X_2) \wedge \mbox{follows2}(X_2, X_1) \wedge \mbox{means}(X_1, Y_1) \wedge \mbox{means}(X_2, Y_2)$\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $rightarrow \exists e \; \mbox{parse-as}(e, X_1, X_2) \wedge vp(e) \wedge \mbox{means}(e, comp(Y_1,Y_2))$\\
%
%For example, we can augment the syntactic rule\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{VP} \leftarrow \mbox{verb}, \mbox{NP} $\\
%with\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{VP}(\mbox{comp}(Sem_1,Sem_2)) \leftarrow \mbox{verb}(Sem_1), \mbox{NP}(Sem_2)$\\
%where the $Sem$'s are variables containing the ``semantics'' of phrases.\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{S} \leftarrow \mbox{NP}, \mbox{VP} $\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{S}(Predicate) \leftarrow \mbox{NP}(Subject), \mbox{VP}(Subject * Predicate) $\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{VP}(X) rightarrow \mbox{com}(\mbox{loves},\mbox{mary})$\\
%which creates a new entity $e_7$ with the meaning of "love".\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{lexeme-love}(X_1) rightarrow \exists e \; \mbox{concept}(e) \wedge \mbox{means}(e, \mbox{concept-love})$\\
%
%The final step of semantic parsing uses a special trick,  ``de-reification'' (\S\ref{sec:reification}):\\
%\hspace*{1cm} (assume that $e_{8}, e_{9}$ denote the persons John and Mary)\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{de-reify}(\mbox{concept-love}, e_{8}, e_{9})$\\
%which generates the logical statement:\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{loves}_1(e_{8},e_{9})$\\
%
%Finally we have:\\
%\hspace*{1cm} $\mbox{means}(e_0, \mbox{loves}_1)$

\section{Comprehensive grammatical categories of English}

Here are some NL grammatical categories (intended to cover as broadly as possible) and typical examples in English.  Designers of NL interfaces can supply translations to these examples.  [The contents in this section and all the examples are taken directly from the book "English Grammar" by Peter Collins, 1998, Addison Wesley.  \todo{NOTE:  This may be a copyright infringement but I have contacted the author without getting his reply.}]  This page is intended to provide a simple comparison of NL interfaces, not meant to be a standard grammar for AGI purposes.

\section{Geniform -- a logical form for natural language}
\label{sec:geniform}

% Rus proposed a popular logical form for rendering natural language, which is of reference value.  Geniform has made several significant improvements over it.

The Geniform logical form is special in that it can represent all natural-language grammatical categories elegantly.  To illustrate this, consider:\\
\tab \english{John loves Mary}\\
which is rendered in predicate logic as:\\
\tab \formula{loves(john, mary)}\\
(ignoring tense).  But what if we want to say:\\
\tab \english{\textit{Loving Mary} is foolish} ?\\
The verb phrase \english{loving Mary} is a grammatical unit that has a specific meaning but it cannot be represented in predicate logic.  In computational linguistics we usually use the \textbf{$\lambda$-abstraction} to represent it:\\
\tab \formula{$\lambda$x.loves(x, mary)}\\
but as you can see, this form is not very human-readable.

% One idea is to replace $\lambda$-abstractions with \textbf{combinators}\footnote{This idea came from Curry's combinatory logic, which has computational power equivalent to that of $\lambda$-calculus.  The technique of Currying was also invented by Curry.}.  For example,\\
% \tab \formula{loves(x, y)}\\
% can be represented in \textbf{Curried form} as:\\
% \tab \formula{\textbf{loves} = $\lambda$y($\lambda$x.loves(x,y))}\\
% so that \formula{\textbf{loves}} is equivalent to the original predicate but it takes its arguments one at a time.

% Now we can represent elements like:\\
% \tab \english{John loves ....} as \formula{(\textbf{loves} john)} and\\
% \tab \english{.... loves Mary} as \formula{(\textbf{C loves} mary)}\\
% where \formula{\textbf{C}} is a combinator with the property \formula{\textbf{C}XYZ = \textbf{C}XZY}.

Instead of $\lambda$-expressions, Geniform uses \textbf{combinators} to represent concepts, resulting in a more elegant syntax that uses only application $(a \circ b)$ and pairing $(a,b)$ \footnote{For details about combinatory concept composition, please see \S\ref{sec:composition}.}.  So,\\
\tab \english{John loves Mary}\\
would be\\
\tab \formula{((mary $\circ$ loves) $\circ$ john)}.\\
For simplicity we can omit the $\circ$ and write:\\
\tab \formula{((mary loves) john)}.\\
And because of associativity we can also omit the parentheses:\\
\tab \formula{mary loves john}.\\
Notice that this \textit{logic formula} looks exactly like English \textit{in reverse}!

Geniform can express any NL category.  For example:\\
\tab chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{chair}\\
\tab wooden chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{wooden chair}\\
\tab a chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{a chair}\\
\tab chairs $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{plural chair}\\
\tab 3 chairs $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(3, plural) chair}\\
\tab 3 wooden chairs $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(3, plural, wooden) chair}\\
\tab any chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{any chair}\\
\tab no chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{no chair}\\
Notice that \formula{(chair)} does not denote \textit{one} chair; it is just an instantiation of the abstract concept of ``chair''; additional predicates are needed to specify it.  For example, the application of \formula{(a)} or \formula{(the)} specifies that \formula{(chair)} is singular, and the application of \formula{(3)} specifies that \formula{(chair)} numbers 3.  It may stretch your understanding a bit to think of ``any chair'' and ``no chair'' as instances of ``chair'', but I think the idea is sound.

% Now let's add some syntactic sugar.  The notation \formula{(a \app b)} denotes \textbf{function application} in combinatory logic:  \formula{(a \app b)} is the same as \formula{a(b)}.  The notation \formula{(a -b)} is just syntactic sugar for \formula{(b \app a)}, ie, it expresses function application in a postfix way that makes it look more like English.  So:\\
% \tab the chair $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{the chair}\\
% \tab chairs $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(chair -s)}\\
% \tab \tab $\equiv$ \formula{(s chair)}\\
% \tab \tab $\equiv$ \formula{(plural chair)}\\
% \tab 3 wooden chairs $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(3, wooden) \app (chair -s)}\\
% \tab unexpectedly $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(un \app expect -ed -ly)}

More examples:\\
\tab expected $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{did expect} \footnote{It is perhaps interesting to note that linguists believe the English past tense such as \english{expected} has evolved from the form \english{expect} + \english{did}.}\\
\tab unexpectedly $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{ly not did expect}

We may (but I'm not sure yet) need a way to differentiate parts of speech, eg:\\
\tab \english{He loves her} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{her:pronoun loves:verb he:pronoun}.

If the logic has types, we can use intrinsic types to represent parts-of-speech tags; otherwise we can use predicates to emulate types.  Currently I have decided that Genifer's logic is untyped.  % Notice that if we write:\\
% \tab \formula{verb(love)}\\
% where \formula{(love)} is a predicate, \formula{(verb)} would be a second-order predicate and thus requires higher-order logic.

%In this section, ``sentence'' refers to NL sentences;  ``formula'' refers to logic formulae.

There may be additional problems in rendering NL into logical form:
\begin{compactenum-}[\textbullet ]
\item NL notions of \english{and} and \english{or} are not exactly the same as logical $\wedge, \vee$.
\item NL notions of \english{not} are not exactly the same as logical $\neg$.
\item NL notions of \english{for all} and \english{there is} are not exactly the same as logical $\forall, \exists$.
\end{compactenum-}
But I speculate that these minor differences can be corrected manually or via machine learning.

\subsection{Nouns / noun phrases}

%Every noun (except special nouns such as pronouns) corresponds to a concept which is represented by a predicate.  For example, the word:chair corresponds to the concept:chair and is represented by the predicate \code{concept-chair()}.

\subsubsection{Common nouns}

\english{chair} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{chair}

\english{wooden chair} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(wooden chair)}

\english{chairs} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(chair -s)} $\equiv$ \formula{(s chair)} $\equiv$ \formula{plural(chair)}

\subsubsection{Proper nouns}

\english{China} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{china}

\subsubsection{Pronouns}

\todo{Currently the Genifer prototype doesn't try to resolve pronoun references.}

\english{she} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{she}

\subsection{Verbs}

\subsubsection{Main verbs}

\english{John \textbf{smiles}} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(present-tense smile) john}

\english{John \textbf{loves} Mary} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{((mary, present-tense) love) john}

\subsubsection{Auxiliary verbs}

\english{John \textbf{has} tried} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{((did try) has) john}\\
\tab \tab \tab or \formula{((has, did) try) john} \\
but I believe the first version is correct.

\english{She \textbf{is} dancing the lambada.} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{the lambada dancing is she}

\english{He \textbf{has not} slept for 2 days.} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{((((2, plural) day for, past-participle) sleep) , not) has he}

\subsection{Adjectives}

\subsubsection{Attributive}

\english{\textbf{young} girl} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{young girl}

\subsubsection{Predicative}

\english{Evelyn is \textbf{male}} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{male evelyn}

It is interesting that the syntactic form for the sentence \english{Evelyn is male} and the noun phrase \english{the male Evelyn} are identical.  But if we consider the sentence \english{The male Evelyn won the prize}, we will see that its logical form consists of 2 sub-statements \english{Evelyn won the prize} and \english{[the] Evelyn [who won the prize] is male}.

\subsubsection{Gradation}

\english{Mary is \textbf{very shy}} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{very shy mary}

\subsubsection{Comparison}

\english{Mary is \textbf{prettier}} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{more pretty mary}

\english{Mary is \textbf{prettiest}} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{most pretty mary}

\subsection{Adverbs}

(Tense ignored)

\english{John talks \textbf{fast}} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{fast talks john}

\english{John walks \textbf{slowly}} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{ly slow walks john}

It seems that the modifier "-ly" is redundant and the logical form can be simply:\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab \formula{slow walks john}

\subsection{Determinatives}

\subsubsection{Articles}

\english{\textbf{The} cat is black} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(black, the) cat}

\subsubsection{Demonstratives}

\english{\textbf{This} cat is black} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(black, this) cat}

\subsubsection{Interrogatives}

I have not thought about the representation of \textbf{questions} in logic.  This is tentative:

\english{\textbf{Which} cat is black?} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(black, which) cat}

We need to add some sort of tag to mark this as a question rather than an ordinary statement.

\subsubsection{Cardinal numerals}

(Plurals ignored)

\english{\textbf{3} mangoes} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{3 mango}

\english{John has \textbf{3} mangoes} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{3 mango has john}

\subsubsection{Quantifiers}

(Plurals ignored)

\english{\textbf{All} men are mortal} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(mortal, all) man} 

\english{\textbf{Most} AGI researchers are crazy} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(crazy, most, agi) researcher}

\english{\textbf{Every} person in the room is happy} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(every, the room in, happy) person}

\subsubsection{Prepositions}

\english{John is \textbf{in} the kitchen} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{the kitchen in john}

\english{John stands \textbf{before} Mary} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{mary before stands john}

\english{John programs \textbf{in} Lisp} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{lisp in programs john}

\english{John eats spaghetti \textbf{with} chop-sticks} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(chopSticks with, spaghetti) eats john}

With tense:\\
\english{John cheated \textbf{during} the exam} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(the exam during, did) cheat john}

\subsubsection{Subordinates}

\english{They danced \textbf{until} it rains} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{s$_2$ until s$_1$}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_1$ := did dance they}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_2$ := present rain it}\\
where the s$_i$'s are statements.

As a general rule, every syntactic structure must separate when they minimally qualify as a proposition, ie, having a truth value.

\english{Paul will go \textbf{if} John goes} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{s$_2$ if s$_1$}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_1$ := go will paul}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_2$ := present go john}

\todo{There is a slight irregularity in the above translation.  We could have written:\\
\tab + \formula{s$_2$ := future go paul}.
}

\english{Pete is taller \textbf{than} John} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{john than more tall pete}

\english{Water conducts electricity \textbf{because} it contains ions}  $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{s$_2$ because s$_1$}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_1$ := (electricity, present) conduct water}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_2$ := (plural ion, present) contain it}

\subsubsection{Coordinators}

\english{John prefers Lisp \textbf{but} Pete prefers Java} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{s$_2$ but s$_1$}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_1$ := (lisp, present) prefer john}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_2$ := (java, present) prefer pete}

\english{She \textbf{neither} hates him \textbf{nor} loves him} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{s$_2$ neither-nor s$_1$}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_2$ := him hates she}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_1$ := him loves she}\\
$\Longrightarrow$ \todo{ ??? a bit unsatisfactory... }

\english{John is male \textbf{or} John is female} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{s$_2$ or s$_1$}\\
\tab + \formula{male john}\\
\tab + \formula{female john}\\
$\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(male john) $\vee$ (female john)}

\subsection{Phrases}

\subsubsection{Noun phrase}

\english{large birds with sharp claws} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{((sharp, plural) claw with, large, plural) bird}

\english{writers of science fiction, who are here for a conference} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{(a conference for here, science fiction of, plural) writer}

\subsubsection{Verb phrase}

\english{[Lisa] \textbf{trains} 3 times a week} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{((a week per, 3) times, present) train} $\;$ or\\
\tab \formula{((a week, 3) times, present) train}

\english{[I] would not \textbf{change} anything} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{(anything, not) change would} $\;$ or\\
\tab \formula{(anything, not, would) change}.\\
The first version seems correct.

\english{[Many footballers] \textbf{get} injured} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{injured get}

\subsubsection{Adjective phrase}

\english{too rebellious} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{too rebellious}

\english{fiercer than I expected} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{c$_1$ than more fierce}\\
\tab + \formula{(c$_1$, did) expect i}\\
where c$_1$ is an introduced constant.

\english{sorry that he hurt her feelings} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{s$_1$ that sorry}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_1$ := ((her, plural) feeling, did) hurt he}

\english{aware of the consequences} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(the, plural) consequence of aware}

\subsubsection{Adverb phrase}

\english{most reluctantly} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(most, ly) reluctant}

\english{more defiantly than they had predicted} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{(c$_1$ than more, ly) defiant}\\
\tab + \formula{(c$_1$, past-participle) predict had they}

\subsubsection{Prepositional phrase}

\english{with a spoon} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{a spoon with}
% $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{$\lambda$x.with(x, (a \app spoon))}\\

\english{way below standard} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{(standard, way) below}

\subsubsection{Genitive phrase}

\english{The princess's popularity} $\Longrightarrow$ \formula{the princess popularity}\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab or \formula{the princess of popularity}\\
\tab\tab\tab\tab or \formula{(the princess of, popular) nounification}

\section{Some example English sentences}
\label{sec:English-examples}

\textbf{1.} \english{If Oswald hadn't shot Kennedy, someone else would have.} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{s$_2$ implies s$_1$}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_1$ := (\underline{(kennedy, did) shoot}, not), did) have Oswald}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_2$ := (\underline{(kennedy, did) shoot} have, did) will someone}.

\todo{The underlined part should be shared.}\\
\todo{The if-then syntax is not rendered naturally.}

\textbf{2.} \english{There I am, minding my own business, when this tall blonde walks up and asks me for a cigarette.} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{s$_2$ when s$_1$}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_1$ := [(my own business, present) mind, there] am i}\\
\tab + \formula{s$_2$ := [(a cigarette for me, present) ask, (up, present) walk, this, tall] blonde}

\textbf{3.} \english{Bison that rounded a snake while grazing, met a stack of green hay. But the bison waited for the hay to turn yellow before it started to eat. Once it turns yellow, hay becomes very tasty.} \footnote{This sentence was made up by Ivan Vodi\u{s}ek during a mailing-list discussion.} $\Longrightarrow$\\
\tab \formula{s$_1$ := [((gazing while, a snake), did) round, ((green hay of, a) stack, did) meet] bison}\\
\tab \formula{s$_2$ := [yellow turn to, the hay for, did] wait bison}\\
